Introduction

  Fast lookup and can be used
  to optimize many algorithms.

What are Hash Tables

  Applications of hash tables
  - spell checkers
  - dictionaries
  - compilers
  - code editors

  // They have different names
  // in different languages.

  Java       => HashMap
  JavaScript => Object
  Python     => Dictionary
  C#         => Dictionary

  Basically they store key value pairs.

  Ex:
  employeeNumber -> employee

  So we take the
  employeeNumber
    -> pass to hash function
    -> output is the address
      for the index

  The hash function is
  deterministic.

  // same input will produce the same output

  This enables the hash function to
  be used for both storing
  and retrieving values.

  Internally a hash map uses an array
  to store its data.

  Operations
  - insert
  - lookup
  - delete

  // all are generally accepted as O(1)

  worst case is O(n)


Working with Hash Tables

  Java map interface

  A contract that map data structures
  should provide.


  Most of the time will use
  HashMap.

  // Hashtable is legacy

  ConcurrentHashMap used for
  multithreaded Applications.


  import java.util.Map;

  public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      Map<Integer, String> map = new HashMap<>();
      // so Map is an interface
      // and on right side, HashMap
        // is an implementation of this interface

      map.put(1, "Steven");
      map.put(2, "John");
      System.out.println(map);
    }
  }

  In HashMaps we cannot have duplicate keys,
  so they will override.

  map.remove(1);


  // to check for the existence of a value
  var value = map.get(3);


  // return boolean
  map.containsKey(3); // O(1)
  map.containsValue("Steven"); // O(n)


  To iterate over hash maps.

  We have useful methods from Map interface,

  entrySet()
    => returns a list of key value pairs

  keySet()
    => returns a list of keys


  for (var item: map.keySet()) {
    System.out.println(item);
  }



  for (var item: map.entrySet()) {
    System.out.println(item.getKey());
    System.out.println(item.getValue());
  }


Exercise - Finding the first non-repeated character

  Popular interview question.

  public static void main(String[] args) {

  }

  // code is found in java file
  HashMapNonRepeatingChar.java


solution - first non-repeating character

  Mosh's implementation


  public char findFirstNonRepeatingChar(String str) {
    Map<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

    // to iterate over a string in java,
    // we must convert it to a character array
    // in order to make it iterable
    for (var ch : str.toCharArray()) {
      if (map.containsKey(ch)) {
        var count = map.get(ch);
        map.put(ch, count);
      } else {
        map.put(ch, 1);
      }
    }
  }

  can improve this code

  public char findFirstNonRepeatingChar(String str) {
    Map<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    var chars = str.toCharArray();

    for (var ch : chars) {
      // use the ternary operator
      // when assigning a value based
      // on a conditional
      var count = map.containsKey(ch) ? map.get(ch) : 0;
      map.put(ch, count + 1);
    }

    for (var ch : chars) {
      if (map.get(ch) == 1)
        return ch;
    }

    // so this returns a character
    // data type of null
    return Character.MIN_VALUE;
  }


  So the hash function determines
  where items should be inserted.

  So they are not inserted sequentially.


sets

  So the set data structure is similar
  to a hash map but slightly different.

  Maps: keys -> v

  Sets: keys

  So sets only have keys and don't
  have values.


  Sets are useful since they don't
  allow duplicate keys.

  // so ensure a unique list

  -

  Java has a generic interface for Set

  The most commonly used implementation
  is HashSet.


  Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
  int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1 };
  for (var number : numbers) {
    set.add(number);
  }
  System.out.println(set);


  // can get the size of a set,
  // can clear it, or iterate
  // over it

exercise - first repeated character

  string is
  green apple

  FIND the first repeated char

  my code:

  public char firstRepeatingChar(string str) {
    Set<Character> set = new HashSet<>();
    char[] chars = str.toCharArray();
    for (var char : chars) {
      if (chars.contains(char)) {
        return char;
      }
      set.add(char);
    }
    return Character.MIN_VALUE;
  }


solution - first repeated character

  // same solution

hash functions

  So analyze how hash functions
  work internally
  and why there are fast.

  So when calling .put()
  The HashMap gets the key and
  uses its value to determine
  where to store its value in memory.

  It maps it to an index value
  in an array.

  A hash function gets a value
  and maps it to a hash code
  // or hash code digest.

  It uses the modules operator
  to ensure that the index
  is within the array size.

  So a basic implementation of this
  just for demonstration.

  public static int hash(int number, int arraySize) {
    return number % arraySize;
  }

  But what if key is a string?

  How to convert to an index?

  NOTE: Every character is represented
  internally as a number.

  So get the numeric representation
  of the number, sum them,
  and will then have a big number
  that you can perform modules on.

  Ex:

  public static int hash(String key, int arraySize) {
    int hash = 0;
    for (var ch : keys.toCharArray()) {
      // so augmented assignment
      // will automatically
      // convert to an integer
      // due to implicit casting
      hash += ch;
    }
    return hash % arraySize;
  }

  These are simplified versions
  of a hash function implementations
  as there are many
  algorithms to perform this.

  Cryptography for example,
  generating a long complicated string,

  In Java, every object
  has a method,
  hasCode()

  Ex:
    String s = "";
    s.hashCode();
    // it'll convert the object
    // into a hash value


collisions

  When generating hash values,
  it's possible that two distinct
  keys could map to the same index address.

  There are two ways to handle collisions.

  Have each cell in our array point to a
  linked list.

  So instead of storing the values themselves,
  you store a reference to a node.

  Simply add to the end.

  // this is chaining


  -
  The other way to handle a collision
  is to find another open slot to
  store the value.

  // this is known as open addressing


  So in summary
  to handle collisions

  - chaining
  - open addressing


chaining

  Refer to the cells or elements
  of an array as
  buckets/slots.

  Wrap the value in a Linked List node.


open addressing - linear probing

  In this implementation,
  we store values directly in
  slots.

  Probing means searching.

  There are 3 searching/probing algorithms.
    - linear probing
    - quadratic probing
    - double hashing

  linear Probing

  Start from calculated index and continue
  iterating through array until find
  an empty slot.

  If can't find an empty slot,
  // this is a drawback of using the
  // open addressing strategy

  as must create a new table
  with an updated size.

  Then must re-insert all the key-> value pairs.

  Linear probing: hash(key) + i

  So i acts like a loop variable.

  Need to use modules to ensure that
  the index value is always within
  the bounds of the inner array.

  There's a problem with linear probing.


  The storing of items is likely to
  form a cluster.

  // So every key-> value pair
  // added takes longer
  // as must probe/search longer
  // for an empty slot.

  The cluster then just becomes bigger
  and ruins the performance
  of our hash table.


open addressing - quadratic probing

  This probing algorithms
  attempts to solve the problem
  of clustering.

  Linear probing algorithm

    hash(key) + i
      % table_size

  Quadratic probing algorithm

    hash(key) + i^2
      % table_size


  So now key -> value pairs
  will be spread out more widely.

  In both algorithms you
  MUST always
  perform modules of the table size.


  Since performing big jumps,
  may end up in an infinite loop.

open addressing - double hashing

  This solves the problem of infinite
  loops so
  instead of using i or i^2

  We use a separate, independent,
  hash function
  to calculate.


  Doubling hashing
    // popular

    hash2(key) = prime - (key % prime)



  The prime number must be
  smaller than the size of our table.


  So to calculate the index based on
  the double hasing algorithm.

  (hash1(key) + i * hash2(key)) % table_size

  Break this down.

  (hash1(key)) => generate the hash code

  i * hash2(key) => calculate the iteration steps

    // THIS is where i or i^2 would have been


    The only different here is that we are doing

    i * hash2

    Linear: i
    quadratic: i^2
    double: i * hash2


  -
  An overview

  // with a table size of 5

  hash1(key) = key % table_size

  hash2(key) = 3 - (key % 3)

  index = (hash1 + i * hash2) % value



  // i will be incremented
  // until an empty slot if found.

  So the key->value pairs
  will now be spread out.


exercise - build a HashTable

  HashTable
    put(k, v)
    get(k): v
    remove(k)

    k: integer
    v: string
    Collisions: chaining

  We are storing both the key
  and value together.

  We are storing both the key
  and value together in our hash table.

  So a private class,
  KeyValuePair which would wrap
  the key and value pairs as instance variables.


  LinkedList[]

  [LL, LL, LL]
  // SO every element is a linked list


  NOTE: That in Java,
    LinkedList is a generic class.

    So must specify

    LinkedList<Entry>[]



solution - put()

  public class HashTable {
    private class Entry {
      private int key;
      private String value;

      public Entry(int key, String value) {
        this.key = key;
        this.value = value;
      }
    }

    private LinkedList<Entry>[] entries = new LinkedList[10];

    public void put(int key, String value) {
      var index = hash(key);
      if (entries[index] == null)
        entries[index] = new LinkedList<>();

      var bucket = entries[index];
      var entry = new Entry(key, value);

      // we want to avoid duplicates,
      // so must first iterate
      for (var entry : bucket) {
        if (entry.key == key) {
          // update the value
          entry.value = value;
          return;
        }
      }
      bucket.addLast(entry);
    }

    private int hash(int key) {
      // may want to use Math.abs()
      // to ensure it's positive
      return key % entries.length;
    }
  }

solution - get()


  public String get(int key) {
    var index = hash(key);
    var bucket = entries[index];
    if (bucket != null) {
      for (var entry : bucket) {
        if (entry.key == key) {
          return entry.value;
        }
      }
    }
    return null;
  }

solution - remove()

  public void remove(int key) {
      int index = hash(key);
      var bucket = entries[index];
      if (bucket == null)
          throw new IllegalStateException();
      for (var entry : bucket ) {
          if (entry.key == key) {
              bucket.remove(entry);
              return;
          }
      }
      throw new IllegalStateException();
  }

solution - refactoring

  Refactoring is a creative process since developers
  refactor differently.

  Should have automated test before you refactor your code.
