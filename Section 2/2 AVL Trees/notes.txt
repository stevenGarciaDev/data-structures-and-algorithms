introduction

  Searching for a value in Binary Search Tree is O(log n)
  // only if the tree is balanced
  otherwise will become O(n)

  AVL trees ensure that the tree is balanced

balanced and unbalanced trees

  In a balanced tree.

  height(left) - height(right) <= 1

  A perfect tree is a tree where every level
  if full.
  (except for the last level)

  In reality, trees are not 'perfect'.

  Often not perfectly balanced.

  So we want the heights of the left and
  right subtrees to only differ by at most
  1 level.

  It'll have a tendency to become
  left skewed or right skewed.

  -> they are linked list in this case,
  // not binary search trees


  How do our trees become imbalanced?

    => This occurs when we insert
    values in a sorted order.
    // ascending or descending


  There are different types of self-balancing trees.

    * AVL trees
      // the tree rebalanced themselves

    * red-black trees

    * B-trees

    * splay trees

    * 2-3 trees

  Don't come up in interviews.
  Most software engineers don't know all trees.


rotations

  AVL trees are special type of binary search trees
  which automatically rebalance themselves
  every time we add or remove nodes.

  They ensure that the difference
  in the heights of the left and right subtrees
  is never more than one.

  If the difference is greater than one,
  then they will rebalance themselves
  by performing a rotation.

  Types of rotations.

    * left
    * right
    * left-right
    * right-left

  The rotation that you perform depends
  on which side of the tree is heavy.

  Left Rotation

    (1)
      \
        (2)
          \
            (3)

  So to calculate the heights,
  always start with the node that you
  just added.

  If right heavy, then need to perform a left rotation.

  0(1)2
    \
      0(2)1
        \
          0(3)0


  So node with the value of 1 is imbalanced.

  Imagine putting a weight on the right heavy
  node that is right heavy

    *
  0(1)2
    \
      0(2)1
        \
          0(3)0

    // So the weight drops it

      (2)
      / \
    (1)  (3)


  Right Rotation

      (3)
      /
    (2)
    /
  (1)

  Calculate at which node you
  have an imbalance.


        2(3)0
        /
      1(2)0
      /
    0(1)0

  So need to put a weight on the imbalanced node.

        *
      2(3)0
      /
    1(2)0
    /
  0(1)0


  // So the weight drops it

    (2)
    / \
  (1)  (3)


  Left-right rotation
  (double rotation)

      (10)
      /
    (5)
      \
      (7)

    There are times when you can't
    rebalance a tree using a left or
    right rotation.

  Need to combine these rotations.

  So start by calculating the height.


      2(10)0
      /
    0(5)1
      \
      0(7)0

  So the imbalance is in the left child,
  right subtree.

  So perform a left rotation, followed
  by a right rotation.

    /
   v
    then
        \
         v

    So first we perform a left rotation
    on the node with the value of 5.

  The 5 should go down and the 7 should go up.

  It's like putting a weight on 5.


    2(10)0
    /
    *
  0(5)1
    \
    0(7)0

    becomes


      (10)
      /
    (7)
    /
  (5)

  Now have a left heavy tree.
  and need to use a right rotation.


  Right Left rotation

    So here the imbalance
    is in the right child,
    left subtree.

     (5)
       \
        (10)
        /
      (7)

    So find the heights.

    0(5)2
      \
       1(10)0
       /
     0(7)0


    To now put a weight on the
    imbalanced right child.

    (5)
      \
       (7)
          \
          (10)

    So now a left rotation.

      (7)
    /    \
   (5)  (10)


AVL trees

  After performing an insertion,
  you begin calculating the height
  of the node that you just inserted.

  ...


Exercise: AVL rotations

  Completed

Exercise: Building an AVL trees

  Create class AVLTree
    within it have a private class AVLNode

    Implement the insert() recursively
    // like a binary search class

  // for now don't worry about balancing the tree


Solution: Insert()

  // consider the scenarios
  // if the tree is empty,
  // and consider the conditionals
  insert(root, value) {
    if (root === null) {
      return new AVLNode(value);
    }

    if (value < root.value) {
      root.left = insert(root.left, value);
    } else {
      root.right = insert(root.right, value);
    }

    return root;
  }


  NOTE: To test your code, walk through your code
  using a debugger.

  So can check its execution step by step.

Exercise: Height Calculation

  Now need to be able to calculate the height
  of every node.

  And check the balance factor.

  Introduce a new field for the AVLNode class,
  for the height.

  When we insert the new node, we should update the heights
  of all the parents of that new node.


  // root.height = MAX(left, right) + 1;

Solution: Height Calculation

Exercise: Balance Factor

  Need to check to see if our tree is unbalanced.

  So after we insert a new node.
  After we set the height, we need to compare
  the left and right subtrees and ensure that
  the difference is not more than 1.

  // balanceFactor = height(left) - height(right);

  if balance factor > 1
    then the tree is left heavy

    Example:
    5 - 3 = 2

  balance factor < -1
    then the tree is right heavy



Solution: Balance Factor

  NOTE: One way to make code a bit cleaner
    is to make helper methods for the conditionals.


    isLeftHeavy(node) {
      return this.balanceFactor(node) > 1;
    }

    isRightHeavy(node) {
      return this.balanceFactor(node) < -1;
    }


    balanceFactor(node) {
      return (node === null) ? 0 : height(node.leftChild) - height(node.right);
    }

    ---

    so now within the insert method becomes

    const balancedFactor = this.balanceFactor(root);
    if (this.isLeftHeavy(root)) {
      //
    } else if (this.isRightHeavy(root)) {
      //
    }

Exercise: Detecting Rotations

  Right skewed

  10
    \
    20
      \
        30

    So we do a left rotate on 10.

    leftRotate(10)


  10
    \
      30
      /
    20

    rightRotate()
    leftRotate()

    Since the imbalance is a right child,
    left subtree.

    On which nodes?

    rightRotate(30)

  So then it'll become

  10
    \
      30
      /
    20

    to

    10
      \
        20
          \
            30


    leftRotate(10)

  --

  So to detect what rotation we need,
  we must find out what is the shape
  of our tree.

  We use the balance factor to determine
  our rotations.

  so if

  10
    \
     30  (1)  balanceFactor(root.right) > 0
    /
    20


  So in the insert method,
  extend the logic,
  and print the rotation that we need.

Solution: Detecting Rotations

  So print out the rotation that we need.

  Mosh's Solution:

  Abstract the insert method by creating helper methods.





  private void balance(AVLNode root) {
    if (isLeftHeavy(root)) {
      System.out.println(root.value + " is left heavy");

      if (balanceFactor(root.leftChild) < 0) {
        System.out.println("Left Rotate " + root.leftChild.value);
      }
      System.out.println("Right Rotate " + root.value);

    } else if (isRightHeavy(root)) {

      if (balanceFactor(root.rightChild) > 0) {
        System.out.println("Right Rotate " + root.rightChild.value);
      }
      System.out.println("Left Rotate " + root.value);
    }
  }

Exercise: Implementing Rotations

  10
    20
      30

    So perform leftRotate(10)

    SO

  10 root
    20 newRoot
      30


    So to perform a left rotate on the 10.
    Make the 10, the left child of the 20.

    newRoot = root.right;
    newRoot.left = root;

  But what if the right child already has a
  left child?

  For example:

  10
    \
     20
     /  \
    15  30

    Then it'll become

      20
    /    \
  10    30
    \
    15

  So the code.

  newRoot = root.right;
  root.right = newRoot.left;
  newRoot.left = root;

     20
    /   \
  10    30
    \
    15

  So whenever perform a rotation,
  should recalculate the height
  of the root and the newRoot.

  // reset the height of the root and newRoot

  Also private void balance(AVLNode root)

  should return an AVLNode.


  implement

  @return AVLNode
  rotateLeft(AVLNode)

  @return AVLNode
  rotateRight(AVLNode)


  Then in the balance()
  instead of printing, call the rotate methods
  and return the new root in that method

  and reassign


  rotateLeft(root) {
    let newRoot = root.right;
    root.right = newRoot.left;
    newRoot.left = root;
    root = newRoot;
    return root;
  }

  rotateRight(root) {
    let newRoot = root.left;
    root.left = newRoot.right;
    newRoot.right = root;
    root = newRoot
    return root;
  }

Solution: Implementing Rotations

  // for setting the height of a node
  private void setHeight(AVLNode node) {
    node.height = Math.max(
      height(root.leftChild),
      height(root.rightChild)) + 1;
  }

  private AVLNode rotateLeft(AVLNode root) {
    var newRoot = root.rightChild;

    root.rightChild = newRoot.leftChild;
    newRoot.leftChild = root;
    // now reset the height
    setHeight(root);
    setHeight(newRoot);

    return newRoot;
  }

  private AVLNode rotateRight(AVLNode root) {
    var newRoot = root.leftChild;

    root.leftChild = newRoot.rightChild;
    newRoot.rightChild = root;

    // now reset the height
    setHeight(root);
    setHeight(newRoot);

    return newRoot;
  }

  in balance()

  -

  insert(root, value) {
    if (root === null) {
      return new AVLNode(value);
    }

    if (value < root.value) {
      root.left = insert(root.left, value);
    } else {
      root.right = insert(root.right, value);
    }

    root.height = Math.max(
      height(root.left),
      height(root.right)) + 1;

    root = balance(root);

    return root;
  }

  private AVLNode balance(AVLNode root) {
    if (isLeftHeavy(root)) {
      if (balanceFactor(root.leftChild) < 0) {
        root.leftChild = rotateLeft(root.leftChild);
      }
      return rotateRight(root);

    } else if (isRightHeavy(root)) {

      if (balanceFactor(root.rightChild) > 0) {
        root.rightChild = rotateRight(root.rightChild);
      }
      return rotateLeft(root);
    }
    return root;
  }
