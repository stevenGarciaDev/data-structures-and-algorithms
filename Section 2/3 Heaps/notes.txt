Introduction

  A type of binary tree with applications for
  graph algorithms and sorting.

What are Heaps

  A binary heap with 2 properties.

  1) A complete tree

    Meaning that every level (except for the last)
    is completely filled.
    // having left and right children

    And it's filled from left to right.

  2) The value of every node is greater than
    or equal to its children.

    "the heap property"

    // max-heap


  A binary heap.

  The applications of heaps.

    * sorting (HeapSort)
    * Graph Algorithms (shortest path between two nodes)
      // this is the algorithm that powers GPS

    * Priority queues
    * finding the kth smallest/largest value
      (popular interview question)

  Operations

  Ex:
  [10, 5, 17, 4, 12]

  Must satisfy the heap property.

  So we insert a new value into a leaf node.
  And if it's not in the right position,
  then we'll move it up until it's in the right place.

  10

  then

    10
    /
  5

  it satisfies the heap property

    10
  /   \
  5    17

  17 does not satisfy the heap property so
  it must bubble up.

    17
  /   \
 5     10


     17
    /   \
   5     10
  /
 4


     17
    /   \
    5     10
  /  \
 4   22

 So 22 violates the heap property.
 // swap with the parent

         17
        /   \
      22     10
     /  \
    4   5

          22
         /   \
       17     10
      /  \
      4   5


    So now it's a valid binary heap.

  The time complexity,
  is based on the worst case.

  So this would be the height of the tree,
  given that a new node needs to bubble up
  to the root in order to satisfy the
  heap property.


  Bubbling up the item,
  is O(log n)

  In a balanced binary tree,

  h = log(n)

  So the time complexity of searching for a value is O(log n).

  For deletion in heaps,
  we can only delete the root node.
  Must fill it, such that it maintains a complete
  tree.
  // filled from the left,
  // and must satisfy the heap property

  If it violates the heap property,
  then must bubble down.
  // swap node values with the largest child

  Removal
  O(h) = O(log n)

  Finding the max value in a max heap
  is O(1).

Exercise - Working with Heaps

Exercise - Building a Heap

  Implement them using an array.

  It'll be more efficient with memory.

                20 (0)
              /   \
        (1) 10     15 (2)
          /   \
      (3) 4    5 (4)

  So can be referenced by their respective indexes in the array.

  So need to find the children/parent of a node.


  To reach the left child of a node.

  Take the node's index.

  root        -> n
  leftChild   -> 2n + 1
  rightChild  -> 2n + 2

  // let parent be the index

  left = parent * 2 + 1
  right = parent * 2 + 2

  TO reach the parent.

  parent = (index - 1) / 2;


  Create a heap class,
  use an integer array as the heap.

  Implement
  insert(int)
  remove() // removes the root node

  NOTE: must bubble up || down
    as to satisfy the heap property

  So heaps are implemented as arrays,
  but are thought of conceptually
  as a binary tree.

Solution - insert()

  Mosh's solution

  public void insert(int value) {
    if (isFull())
      throw new IllegalStateException();

    items[size++] = value;

    bubbleUp();
  }

  public boolean isFull() {
    return size == items.length;
  }

  private void bubbleUp() {
    var index = size - 1;
    while (index > 0 && items[index] > items[parent(index)]) {
      // then swap the items
      swap(index, parent(index));
      index = parent(index);
    }
  }

  private int parent(int index) {
    return (index - 1) / 2;
  }

  private void swap(int first, int second) {
    var temp = items[first];
    items[first] = items[second];
    items[second] = temp;
  }


  ---

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    var heap = new Heap();
    heap.insert(10);
    heap.insert(5);
    heap.insert(17);
  }


Solution - remove()

  Mosh's implementation

  // must consider the edge cases

  public void remove() {
    // always remove the root node
    // so we move the value of the root node to be the last node
    items[0] = items[size - 1];
    size--;

  }

  // refer to ./JavaScript/heap.js
  // for implementation

  NOTE: For cleaner code, put your lengthy conditionals into
        a private helper method.

        The helper method should simply take some argument,
        and return the boolean result.

Solution - edge cases

  // refer to heap.js file

  Issue in

  largerChildIndex()

  In that it may be a leaf or only have a left child.

  Must check,
  and ensure that the calculated left index
  and calculated right index is less than the size.

  So have to create helper methods.

  private boolean hasLeftChild(int index) {
    return this.leftChildIndex(index) <= this.heapSize;
  }

  private boolean hasLeftChild(int index) {
    return this.rightChildIndex(index) <= this.heapSize;
  }

  -

  So not update the largerChildIndex() helper method.

  private int largerChildIndex(int index) {
    if (!this.hasLeftChild(index)) {
      return index;
    }

    if (!this.hasRightChild(index)) {
      return this.leftChildIndex(index);
    }
  }


  -
  now update helper method, isValidParent()
  which currently assumes that it has two children.

  Must account for scenario of no children or only
  left child.

  isValidParent(index) {
    if (!this.hasLeftChild(index)) {
      return true;
    }

    if (!this.hasRightChild(index)) {
      return this.heap[index] >= this.leftChild(index);
    }

    return this.heap[index] > this.leftChild(index)
            && this.heap[index] > this.rightChild(index);
  }


  When you have repeated expressions, (such as in conditionals)
  consider creating a helper method for more readability.

  // may need to reverse the condition for better naming convention


  Extract into bubbleDown() method.

  bubbleDown(index) {
    // this loop details the bubbleDown process
    while (index <= this.heapSize && !this.isValidParent(index)) {
      // determine which child is larger,
      // to find out which one should swap
      let largerChildIndex = this.largerChildIndex(index);
      this.swap(index, largerChildIndex);

      // reset the index to the largerChildIndex
      index = largerChildIndex;
    }
  }


Heap Sort

  An application of the heap data structure is to sort data.

  You can use it to sort an unsorted array.

  By continually removing the root value,
  the elements will come out in descending order
  for our MaxHeap.

  Could also sort the array.

  Ex:
  // Mosh's implementation in Java

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int[] numbers = { 5, 3, 10, 1, 4, 2};
    var heap = new Heap();
    for (var number : numbers) {
      heap.insert(number); // sort in descending order
    }
    for (var i = 0: i < numbers.length; i++) {
      numbers[i] = heap.remove(); // sort in descending order
    }

    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(numbers));
  }


  for (var i = numbers.length: i >= 0; i--) {
    numbers[i] = heap.remove(); // sort in descending using a loop
  }


Priority Queues

  Priority Queues,
  elements are removed based on their priority.
  // not when they join the queue

  Operating system uses priority queues to schedule tasks.


  The previous implementation is not efficient,
  O(n) since worst case is that all other elements
  need to be shifted.

  And removal with the previous implementation
  is O(1).

  ----

  A heap can also be used to implement a priority queue.

  Insert operation in heap
  O(log n)
    // since need to bubble up
    // and the worst case distance we have
    // to travel is the height of the tree

  Remove
  O(log n)
    // since need to bubbleDown
    // and this is the worst case

  So if you have a lot of insertions,
  then it's more efficient to build a priority
  queue using a heap.

  Mosh's implementation

  public class PriorityQueueHeap {
    private Heap heap = new Heap();

    // add
    public void enqueue(int item) {
      heap.insert(item);
    }

    // remove
    public int dequeue() {
      return heap.remove();
    }

    public boolean isEmpty() {
      return heap.isEmpty();
    }
  }

  So the PriorityQueueHeap class is
  simply a wrapper around the Heap class.

Exercise - Heapify

  Popular interview question is the heapify algorithm means
  to transform an array into a heap in-place.

  Ex:
    int[] numbers = { 5, 3, 8, 4, 1, 2 };
    // heapify(array)

    Basically need a for loop over the array,
    and if it's not in the right position then
    need to bubble it down.

    So compare the element with both its children,
    if invalid,
    then swap with the larger one.

    Recursively do this until the element is a valid parent.

  Then back in main loop, go to the next element.

  function heapify(arr) {
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {

      // then Recursively check if current element
      // is a valid parent and satisfies the heap property
      let leftChild = null;
      let rightChild = null;
      if (index * 2 + 1 < arr.length) {
        leftChild = arr[index * 2 + 1];

        if (index * 2 + 2 < arr.length) {
          rightChild = arr[index * 2 + 2];
        }
      }

      // check if valid parent
      const parent = arr[index];
      if (leftChild !== null && rightChild !== null
        && parent > leftChild && parent > rightChild) {

      }


    }
  }


  // take in an array,
  // modify array in place to satisfy the
  // max heap property
  function heapify(arr) {
    // basically we loop through the array and
    // perform the bubbleDown operation
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
      const parent = arr[i];

      // need to check if satisfies the heap property
      // so need leftChild and right child

      const leftChild = ((i * 2 + 1) > arr.length) ? arr[i * 2 + 1] : null;
      const rightChild = ((i * 2 + 2) > arr.length) ? arr[i * 2 + 2] : null;

      // now consider each case


      // parent is leaf?
      if (leftChild === null && rightChild === null) {
        continue;
      }

      // parent has only left (no right)
      if (rightChild === null) {
        if (parent < rightChild) {
          // then need to perform swap
          swap(arr, i, i * 2 + 1);
        }
      }

      // parent has both left and right, and
      if (parent > leftChild && parent > rightChild) {
        continue; // next iteration
      } else {

        // if parent does not satisfy the heap property
        // find out which child is larger
        if (leftChild > rightChild) {
          swap(arr, i, i * 2 + 1);
        } else {
            swap(arr, i, i * 2 + 2);
        }
      }
    }
  }

  function swap(arr, index1, index2) {
    const temp = arr[index1];
    arr[index1] = arr[index2];
    arr[index2] = temp;
  }

Solution - Heapify

  Mosh's implementation in Java

  -

  public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      int[] numbers = { 5, 3, 8, 4, 1, 2 };
      MaxHeap.heapify(numbers);
      System.out.println(Arrays.toString(numbers));
    }
  }

  public class MaxHeap {
    public static void heapify(int[] array) {
      for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        heapify(array, i);
      }
    }

    private static void heapify(int[] array, int index) {
      // assume default case, that it satisfies the heap property
      var largerIndex = index;

      var leftIndex = index * 2 + 1;
      if (leftIndex < array.length && array[leftIndex] > array[largerIndex]) {
        largerIndex = leftIndex;
      }

      var rightIndex = index * 2 + 2;
      if (rightIndex < array.length && array[rightIndex] > array[largerIndex]) {
        largerIndex = rightIndex;
      }

      if (index == largerIndex) {
        return;
      }

      swap(array, index, largerIndex);

      // then Recursively repeat this step
      // since values at the indexes have been swapped now
      heapify(array, largerIndex);
    }

    private static void swap(int[] array, int first, int second) {
      var temp = array[first];
      array[first] = array[second];
      array[second] = array[first];
    }
  }

Solution - Optimization

  // the previous video's implementation is not optimal
  // for the heapify algorithm

  In a perfect binary tree, half
  of the nodes are in the last level.

  The inefficiency is here

  for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    heapify(array, i);
  }

  We are calling the heapify method
  for every element.

  The purpose of heapify is to ensure
  that every parent satisfies the
  heap property.

  This doesn't need to be performed
  for the leaf nodes.

  // remember,
  // heapify works down the tree

  So to optimize,
  we only need to heapify the parent nodes.

  So to get the index of the last parent node,
  we use a formula.

  n => total number of nodes (size)

  lastParent = (n / 2) - 1

  in other words

  let lastParentIndex = (heapSize / 2) - 1


  So we can change the bounds to
  iterate over the parent nodes

  for (var i = 0; i < array.length / 2 - 1; i++) {
    heapify(array, i);
  }

  -
  We can optimize it further.

  We have a lot of recursion
  with this implementation.

  But we can change the direction of the
  for loop,
  which would lead to fewer recursions.

  // as more will be in the correct position
  // once the for loop gets up to the root

  --


  let lastParentIndex = array.length / 2 - 1;
  for (var i = lastParentIndex; i >= 0; i--) {
    heapify(array, i);
  }



Exercise - Kth largest item

  Find the kth largest item/value in a list.

  int[] numbers = { 5, 3, 8, 4, 1, 2 };

  // so if k = 1
  then return 8
  since 8 is the largest value.

  So could sort it,
  O(nlogn) time complexity
  then simply access by random access.

  Or can perform heapify.
  Then continually remove elements
  from the max heap until proper kth count.

  // assume within MaxHeap class
  findKthValue(array, k) {
    MaxHeap heap = new MaxHeap();
    for (let elem of array) {
      heap.insert(elem);
    }
    while (k > 1) {
      heap.remove();
    }
    return heap.remove();
  }


Solution - Kth largest item

  Mosh's solution

Heaps - Exercises

Summary

  A heap is a complete binary tree
  meaning that every level except for the
  last are filled.

  Filled from the left to the right.

  Min-heap or max-heap.

  Adding or removing an item
  runs in O(logn)
  where we bubble up or down.

  Height is O(logn)
  for insert and remove

  Can't lookup values in heap,
  only the min or max value.
  Can read it in O(1)
